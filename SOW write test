Praekelt will:
- Move the jozihub repository from Praekelt's organization to JoziHub's.

### Database accessed

On approval a 50% deposit is required.

## Assumptions
- Work will commence 10 working days after the cost estimate has been approved.
- Praekelt will be minimally involved with the design of the site.
- Each issue will be tracked in GitHub under their respective issues and will lead towards a milestone.
- Deadlines and delivery dates can only be confirmed once deposit is made and estimated efforts are not a guarantee of scheduled delivery.
